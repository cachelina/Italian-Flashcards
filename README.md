##### Hurdles
>Adding a local storage component was more difficult than anticipated. 
>After I centered divs across screens, I got a bug causing a 1px shift when the card is flipped.
>Redirecting users to results page would take some time and could possibly cause glitches I may not have time to address. Therefore, I chose not to display the percentage scores from previous sessions on the page. You can console log them tho ;)
>Backspace visibility didn't work in safari.
